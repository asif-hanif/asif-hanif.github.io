Currently, I am doing MS in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore</a>. Realizing the potential of deep learning, I have decided to pursue research thesis that involves concepts from machine learning and deep learning. My current research work is on root cause analysis of faults in plants using Bayesian network. Goal is to efficiently learn distribution parameters of Bayesian network using deep neural network such that inference may be done.

Previously, I was research assistant at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk" target="_blank">LUMS</a> from **Oct 2015** to **Dec 2018**. My research revolved around RF sensing applications using commodity-off-the-shelf WiFi radio (Intel 5300 WiFi Card).
