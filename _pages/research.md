I have worked as research assistant at <a href='https://lums.edu.pk' target='_blank'>LUMS</a>  from <b>Oct 2015</b> to <b>Dec 2018</b>. During this period, I worked on RF sensing applications using channel state information (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information' target='_blank'>CSI</a>) extracted from commercially available off-the-shelf WiFi radio (<a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html' target='_blank'>Intel 5300 WiFi Card</a>).</div>

I started experimentation with two laptops(Tx-Rx pair), each equipped with Intel 5300 WiFi card, for intrusion detection. I observed that whenever someone passes through the link between two laptops, while CSI is being captured at receiver, there are significant fluctuations in CSI data. It was my first hands-on experience with RF sensing. Later I worked on multiple applications relying on CSI and was able to publish <a href='https://asif-hanif.github.io/publications/' target='_blank'>two articles</a>. </div>

Here is a list of projects that I have worked on at <a href='https://lums.edu.pk' target='_blank'>LUMS</a>;
 
* Preparation of sensing nodes using commercial off-the-shelf WiFi card (Intel 5300 WiFi Radio)
* Intrusion detection using channel state information (CSI) extracted from WiFi radio
* Through wall human motion detection by exploiting channel state information using horn antennas with WiFi radio
* Non-invasive monitoring and estimation of breathing rate with channel state information
* Non-obtrusive detection of concealed metallic object with WiFi radios
* Angle-of-arrival(AoA) and time-of-flight(ToF) estimation of WiFi signal for indoor localization
* Device-free indoor localization using joint AoA & ToF based fingerprinting
* Indoor localization using proximity sensing using Bluetooth low energy devices

In 2018, I joined <a href='https://itu.edu.pk' target='_blank'>ITU, Lahore</a> for MS degree in electrical engineering. I was awarded graduate research fellowship. Having realized the potential of deep learning, I decided to pursue thesis that relies on concepts from machine learning and deep learning. During first year of MS, I worked on solving inverse problem (Fourier Ptychography) using deep learning model and have one paper that was accepted at <a href="http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/html/LCI/Shamshad_Adaptive_Ptych_Leveraging_Image_Adaptive_Generative_Priors_for_Subsampled_Fourier_ICCVW_2019_paper.html " target="_blank"> ICCV 2019 </a>. Currently, we are working on root cause analysis of faults in industrial plants using <a href='https://itu.edu.pk' target='_blank'>Bayesian network</a>.
