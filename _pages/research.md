I have worked as research assistant at <a href='https://lums.edu.pk' target='_blank'>LUMS</a>  from <b>Oct 2015</b> to <b>Dec 2018</b>. During this period, I worked on RF sensing applications using channel state information (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information' target='_blank'>CSI</a>) extracted from commercially available off-the-shelf WiFi radio (<a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html' target='_blank'>Intel 5300 WiFi Card</a>).</div>

I started experimentation with two laptops(Tx-Rx pair), each equipped with Intel 5300 WiFi card, for intrusion detection. I observed that whenever someone passes through two laptops, while CSI is being captured at receiver, there are significant fluctuations in CSI data. It was my first hands-on experience with RF sensing. Later I worked on multiple applications relying on CSI and published <a href='https://asif-hanif.github.io/publications/' target='_blank'>two articles</a>. </div>

Here is a choronological list of projects that I have worked on;
 
* Preparation of sensing nodes using commodity off-the-shelf hardware (Intel 5300 WiFi Radio)
* Intrusion detection using channel state information (CSI) extracted from WiFi Radio
* Through wall human motion detection by exploiting channel state information
* Non-invasive monitoring and estimation of breathing rate with channel state information
* Non-obtrusive detection of concealed metallic object with WiFi radios
* Angle-of-arrival(AoA) and time-of-flight(ToF) estimation of WiFi signal for indoor localization
* Device-free indoor localization using joint AoA & ToF based fingerprinting
* Indoor localization using proximity sensing using Bluetooth low energy devices
