<h1> About </h1>
<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am associate researcher at <a href="http://cactus.itu.edu.pk/" target="_blank">CACTUS</a> of <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">Information Technology University (ITU), Lahore</a>. I have completed MS in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://itu.edu.pk" target="_blank">ITU</a>. My current research work is on the use of <a href="https://www.bayesserver.com/docs/introduction/bayesian-networks" target="_blank">Bayesian network</a> for root cause analysis (RCA) of faults in industrial plants and identification of most-influential-path between root-cause node and fault-detection point. One of the challenges in using Bayesian network is the exponential growth of distribution parameters with the number of nodes in it. We tackled this issue by efficiently learning distribution parameters of continuous Bayesian network using neural networks. <br>
I have also worked on inverse problems&#151;Fourier Ptychography and Light Field Microscopy&#151;by using recent advances in deep learning.</div>

Previously, I was research assistant at <a href="https://lums.edu.pk" target="_blank">LUMS</a> from <b>2015</b> to <b>2018</b>. My research revolved around RF sensing applications using commodity-off-the-shelf WiFi radio (<a href='https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html' target='_blank'>Intel 5300 WiFi Card</a>).
